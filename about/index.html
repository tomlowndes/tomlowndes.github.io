	<p>I'm a Creative Designer living in Stone,UK working for <a href="https://dovetechnology.co.uk">Dove Technology</a>.</p>

	<p>I love designing things people enjoy, solving tricky technical problems, working with curious people and making sure everyone around me is having a good time.</p>

    <p>Over the course of my career I've got to work with a wide range fantastic people and companies.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>I've created designs nobody cared about.</li>
		<li>I've worked on gnarly legacy applications, efficient microservice systems, and anything in between.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Here are some things I care about or have worked with extensively in the past: <a href="https://tomlowndes.notion.site/Design-Portfolio-94cd918535dd488d877ccd34a72c9df8">Portfolio</a></p>
