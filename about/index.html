	<p>I’m a Creative Designer based in Stone, UK, currently working at <a href="https://dovetechnology.co.uk">Dove Technology</a>.

	<li>I've created designs nobody cared about.</li>
	<li>I've worked on large corporate documents.</li>
	<li>I designed countless banners, posters and leaflets for over 350 European Nurseries</li>
	<li>I've filmed and edited advertisments for social media</li>
