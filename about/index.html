	<h1>Hi, I'm <a href="/blog/ham">Tom!</a></h1>

	<div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/ham.jpg" alt="Ham Vocke" class="img-circle float-right"></div>

	<p>I'm a Creative Designer living in Stone,UK working for <a href="https://dovetechnology.co.uk">Dove Technology</a>.</p>

	<p>I love designing things people enjoy, solving tricky technical problems, working with curious people and making sure everyone around me is having a good time.</p>

    <p>Over the course of my career I got to work with a wide range of domains, technologies and companies.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>I've created designs nobody cared about and features used and loved by millions.</li>
		<li>I've built <abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</abbr> products, <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> household devices, in-car entertainment software, e-commerce systems, deployment pipelines, cloud infrastructure, browser games, call-center software, and much more.</li>
		<li>I've designed and build small features and large systems, consulted and coached teams on modern software engineering practices, led technical teams, created technical visions and system architectures.</li>
		<li>I've worked on gnarly legacy applications, efficient microservice systems, and anything in between.</li>
		<li>I've suffered through manual deployments in the middle of the night and built systems capable of shipping software to millions of users dozens of times per day (and I never want to go back to the former!).</li>

	</ul>

	<p>Here are some things I care about or have worked with extensively in the past:</p>
