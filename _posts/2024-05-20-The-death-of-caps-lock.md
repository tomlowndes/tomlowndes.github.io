In the fast-paced world of design and technology, every keystroke counts. As a designer, I find the Caps Lock key to be largely redundant in my daily workflow. Instead, I rely heavily on shortcuts in programs like DaVinci Resolve, InDesign, and Illustrator. To streamline my productivity, I use an Elgato Stream Deck for launching applications and accessing frequently used shortcuts and automations.

## The Problem with Caps Lock

The Caps Lock key, originally designed for typewriters to capitalize entire words or sentences, has become obsolete in modern computing. Most people use Shift for capitalization, leaving Caps Lock largely unused. This prime real estate on our keyboards could be put to better use.

## Introducing the Hyper Key

The Hyper Key is a powerful replacement for the Caps Lock key on any keyboard, designed to enhance your efficiency by adding customizable shortcuts. By remapping the Caps Lock key to act as a modifier key (like Ctrl, Alt, or Shift), you can unlock a plethora of new shortcuts and commands. After some research, I discovered that AutoHotkey can be used to create a Hyper Key on Windows, transforming my workflow.

### Why the Hyper Key?

1. **Increased Productivity**: Access frequently used functions quickly.
2. **Customization**: Tailor shortcuts to your specific needs.
3. **Efficiency**: Reduce the need to switch between keyboard and mouse.
4. **Ergonomics**: Minimize repetitive strain by reducing unnecessary movements.

## My AutoHotkey Setup

Below are the keybinds I've configured. This setup is a work in progress, and the files are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com).
