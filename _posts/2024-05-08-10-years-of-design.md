In a few weeks, I will celebrate my third anniversary at Dove Technology—a job I was fortunate to land. In early 2019, after working at Busy Bees Nurseries as an in-house creative designer for just over seven years, I was unexpectedly informed that I, along with two other colleagues from the marketing team, were being let go.

The initial shock and panic about how I would pay the bills were overwhelming. However, I soon received an opportunity to work in the warehouse at Dove Technology. It was a physically demanding job, and at over 30 years old, it wasn’t exactly within my skill set. But with bills to pay, any job was better than none. Although decanting roofing adhesive is a rewarding task and working for a family-run business offered a refreshing change of pace, I knew my strengths lay elsewhere. After a year, I approached my bosses and expressed my desire to return to design work. Upon explaining my skills, I was offered the chance to take over in-house printing, design product labels, create internal and external documents, and manage the website.

Throughout my career, I have worked in agency settings, freelanced, and held in-house positions. I’ve handled print and digital projects, dabbled in photography, filmed and edited videos, and created email campaigns and websites. Every day and every project is a learning experience. If I lack knowledge in a certain area, I seek out resources, people, or courses, such as those on Skillshare, to bridge the gap.

My last two jobs have both been in-house positions. I spent seven years at Busy Bees Nurseries, where I had the privilege of working with two amazing bosses and several colleagues who significantly enhanced my skill set. For the past three years, I have continued to develop my skills at Dove Technology, working with a smaller but equally dedicated team.

Currently, I am focused on becoming a more well-rounded designer. I am refining processes and creating templates to ensure that all my work meets a higher standard. To stay organized, I use Notion to track personal projects and Monday.com for work-related tasks. By 2025, my goal is to be more organized with my files, track project progress and time spent, and identify areas for skill improvement.
