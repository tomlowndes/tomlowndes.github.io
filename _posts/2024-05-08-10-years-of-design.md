In a few weeks it will be my 3rd anniversary working at Dove Technology, a job that I was very lucky to land. In early 2019 after working at Busy Bees Nurseries as a in-house creative designer for just over 7 years, I was informed out of the blue that myself and two other colleagues on the marketing team where being let go.

Now after the initial shock and the wtf am I going to do to pay the bills, I was offered the opportunity to work at Dove Technology in the warehouse. A very manually intensive job which I am not afraid to say at my 30+ years on this planet is not what I am good at, but with bills to pay, a job is a job. Now decanting roofing adhesive is a rewarding job and working for a family run and operated business is a nice change of pace. But after a year I told my bosses I was starting to look for a design job. After explaining what I was skilled to do, an opportunity to stay and take over the in house printing of product labels, designing labels for customer labels, internal documents, external resources and managing the website.      

In the span of my career I've worked at agency, freelance and in-house. I've worked on print, digital, dabbled in photography, filmed and edit video, created emailers and websites. Everyday and ever project is a school day. If I didn't have the knowledge then I would find recourses, people or courses like on [skillshare](https://share.skillshare.com/fxywx!dd990e68c2!a).

My past two jobs, have both been in-house 7 years at Busy Bees Nurseries, where I had two amazing bosses and several colleagues who taught me a lot and pushed my skillset to where it is today. And for the past 3 years at Dove Technology where I have pushed my skills whilst working with a smaller team.     

I'm currently trying to become a more rounded designer, working on processes and templates to ensure that all my work is at a higher standard. Working on job tracking using notion to track personal projects and monday.com to track work projects. My aim by 2025 is to be more organised with my files, tracking project, time it has taken, and skills to improve on.
