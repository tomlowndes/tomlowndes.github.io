# Getting Sh*t Done.
Since graduating in 2013, maintaining motivation and keeping track of tasks has been a significant challenge. Over time, I’ve explored various methods to enhance productivity and manage my projects effectively. This journey has led me to adopt and adapt different organizational strategies that have proven beneficial.

#### The Bullet Journal Method:
For over five years, the Bullet Journal method has been my go-to tool. Developed by Ryder Carroll, this system combines mindfulness with productivity, offering a structured yet flexible way to manage tasks, events, and thoughts. Here’s how I use it:

* #### Daily Logs:
Every day, I list out tasks, events, and notes. Tasks are marked with a dot, events with a circle, and notes with a dash. This simple notation helps me quickly identify what needs attention.

* #### Monthly Logs:
At the beginning of each month, I create a spread to list out monthly tasks and important dates. This overview helps in setting monthly goals and keeping track of longer-term commitments.

* #### Future Logs:
For tasks and events that fall outside the current month, the future log provides a space to jot them down, ensuring nothing is forgotten.

#### Van Neistat's Do List:

Inspired by Van Neistat’s approach, I’ve recently incorporated the Do List into my routine. This method involves using an A4 card divided into sections, each holding post-it notes for different tasks. [Check Out his video ](https://youtu.be/lG1DaoJkuBw). Here’s why it works for me:

* #### Visual Organization:
The physical separation of tasks on an A4 card allows for a clear visual representation of what needs to be done, making it easier to prioritize.

* #### Flexibility:
Post-it notes can be easily moved around, removed, or updated, offering flexibility that a traditional list might lack.

* #### Accountability:
Having a physical card that I see daily helps in keeping me accountable and ensures that tasks don’t slip through the cracks.

#### Combining Methods:

While both methods have their strengths, I find that a hybrid approach works best. Here’s how I combine them:

* #### Daily Routine:
I start my day by reviewing my Bullet Journal and the Do List card. This helps in aligning my tasks for the day with my broader goals.

* #### End-of-Day Review:
At the end of the day, I review what has been accomplished and what needs to be carried over. This reflection helps in planning for the next day and keeps me motivated.

By refining and combining these organizational methods, I aim to make 2024 a year of increased productivity and fulfillment. The journey of finding the right tools and strategies has been ongoing, but the benefits of staying organized and motivated are undeniable. Here’s to getting sh*t done in the new year!
