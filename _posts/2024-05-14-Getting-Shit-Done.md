# Getting Sh*t Done.

My issue in life is motivation. Remembering my next task to do, or how to do a something I've not had to do in years has always annoyed me.

Since finishing university back in 2013, one skillset that I have focused on is project management. Putting a system in place to not only help me at work but at home as well.

#### Bullet Journal

The one system that has been consistent for me is bullet Journal. [Check Out Bullet Journal ](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/about) -

"Before we get to the why and how, let’s answer the what.

The Bullet Journal method is a mindfulness practice that works like a productivity system.

There’s Bullet Journal method the System and Bullet Journal method the Practice. The System focuses on What you’re doing, providing tools to capture and organize your thoughts. The Practice focuses on Why you’re doing what you’re doing, providing rituals to help you shed distractions and keep your actions aligned with your values. "

I have been using this system to organize my day to day life for over 5 years, the method and physical notation of inputting my tasks in a structured system has helped me a lot. If I have a task to achieve I note it down, an appointment to remember I note it down.

If it's not written down, I don't remember it and I'm also not held accountable to finish it.

#### The system  

Bullet Journaling uses signifiers to organize notes.

Events are represented by an “O” Bullet.

Tasks are represented by a simple dot “•” and include any kind of actionable items like “Pick up dry cleaning”.

X = Task Complete

/> = Task Migrated (A task that's been moved forward into the next Monthly Log or a Collection)

</ = Task Scheduled (A task that's been moved backward into the Future Log)

Notes are represented with a dash “–”. Notes include: facts, ideas, thoughts, and observations. Notes are entries that you want to remember but aren’t immediately or necessarily actionable.

#### A Book or Paper

I started off by using a notebook and following the full system, doing a contents page, monthly spread, and then using as much space as needed for the day to day.

Recently I've been trying a different approach, taken from Van Neistat. [Check Out his video ](https://youtu.be/lG1DaoJkuBw)

<img title="a title" alt="do list" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.aOoUmT7-RgSLDAyTh5HA3QHaFj%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=f5e9794abbff25fa82a7eed95649cc87804153b36e13e2077576c9012588b4bd&ipo=images">

Van's Approach is a Do list, as its tasks we are doing not putting on.

He splits an A4 card stock into 4 sections, adds post it notes, dates the top and uses it as his weekly tasks. I'm testing a hybrid method of this system but using the signifiers from the bullet system. It can be kept on me or near me at all times. And once filled up kept for future reference.

Hopefully with these improvements to my organization system, 2024 can be the year I get more sh*t done.
