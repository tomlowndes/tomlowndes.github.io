In a few weeks it will be my 3rd anniversary working at Dove Technology, a job that I was very lucky to land. In early 2019 after working at Busy Bees Nurseries as a in-house creative designer for just over 7 years, I was informed out of the blue that myself and two other colleagues on the marketing team where being let go.

Now after the initial shock and the wtf am I going to do to pay the bills, I was offered the opportunity to work at Dove Technology in the warehouse. A very manually intensive job which I am not afraid to say at my 30+ years on this planet is not what I am good at, but with bills to pay, a job is a job. Now decanting roofing adhesive is a rewarding job and working for a family run and operated business is a nice change of pace.  

In the span of my career I've worked at agency, freelance and in-house. I've worked on print, digital, dabbled in photography, filmed and edit video, created emailers and websites. Everyday and ever project is a school day. If I didn't have the knowledge then I would find recourses, people or courses like on [skillshare](https://share.skillshare.com/fxywx!dd990e68c2!a).

My past two jobs, have both been in-house 7 years at Busy Bees Nurseries, where I had two amazing bosses and several colleagues who taught me a lot and pushed my skillset to where it is today. And for the past 3 years at Dove Technology where I have pushed my skills whilst working with a smaller team.     

I'm currently trying to become a more rounded designer, working on processes and templates to ensure that all my work is at a higher standard. Working on job traking using notion to track presonal projects and monday.com to track work projects.
