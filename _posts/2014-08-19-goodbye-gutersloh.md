In a few weeks it will be my 3rd anniversary working at Dove Technology, a job that I was very lucky to land. In early 2019 after working at Busy Bees Nurseries as a in-house creative designer for just over 7 years, I was informed out of the blue that myself and two other colleagues on the marketing team where being let go.

Now after the initial shock and the wtf am I going to do to pay the bills, I was offered the opportunity to work at Dove Technology in the warehouse. A very manually intensive job which I am not afraid to say at my 30+ years on this planet is not what I am good at, but with bills to pay, a job is a job. Now decanting roofing adhesive is a rewarding job and working for a family run and operated business is a nice change of pace.
