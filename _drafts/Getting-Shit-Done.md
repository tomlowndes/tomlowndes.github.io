# Getting Sh*t Done.

My issue in life is motivation, for 30 years I've been told not to be lazy, stupid, slow and not good enough (mainly as a kid at school). But that feeling of not remembering my next job to do, or how to do a task I've not had to do in years has always annoyed me. Back at Uni in my 3rd year, I was diagnosed with dyslexia, which explained a lot of my struggles with reading and writing.

Since finishing university, one skillset that I have focused on is project management and putting a system in place to not only help me at work but at home as well.

#### Bullet Journal

The one system that has been consistent for me is bullet Journal. [Check Out Bullet Journal ](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/about) -

"Before we get to the why and how, let’s answer the what.

The Bullet Journal method is a mindfulness practice that works like a productivity system.

There’s Bullet Journal method the System and Bullet Journal method the Practice. The System focuses on What you’re doing, providing tools to capture and organize your thoughts. The Practice focuses on Why you’re doing what you’re doing, providing rituals to help you shed distractions and keep your actions aligned with your values. "

I have been using this system to organize my day to day life for over 5 years, the method and physical notation of inputting my tasks in a structured system has helped me a lot. If I have a task to achieve I note it down, an appointment to remember I note it down.

If it's not written down, I don't remember it and I'm also not held accountable to finish it.

#### The system  

Bullet Journaling uses signifiers to organize notes.

Events are represented by an “O” Bullet.

Tasks are represented by a simple dot “•” and include any kind of actionable items like “Pick up dry cleaning”.

X = Task Complete

> = Task Migrated (A task that's been moved forward into the nextMonthly Log or a Collection)

< = Task Scheduled (A task that's been moved backward into the Future Log)

Notes are represented with a dash “–”. Notes include: facts, ideas, thoughts, and observations. Notes are entries that you want to remember but aren’t immediately or necessarily actionable.
