# The Death Of The Useless Caps Lock

In my opinion Caps lock is useless and is hardly used in my day to day life as a designer. What I do use, is shortcuts. Shortcuts in specific programs like Davinci resolve, InDesign and Illustrator.

To enhance my love of shortcuts I use and Elgarto Stream Deck [more info]() to launch programs and to access quick shortcuts and automations I use frequently.  

Introducing the Hyper key, a replacement for the caps lock key on any keyboard to add shortcuts to windows to enhance  speed up and make certain shortcuts more ergonomic.

After some googling I found a few examples of using Auto hotkey to achieve my dream of a hyper key on windows. (Mac can use ...)

The Following is how I have set up my shortcuts, It will be a WIP. Files are available on my GitHub [GitHub files]()
