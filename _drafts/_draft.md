## Embracing the Future of Ergonomics: My Journey with a 42-Key Split Keyboard

My journey with a 42-key split keyboard, has so far taught me that i suck at touch typing and that is a skill I need to develop to speed up my day to day life. I bought the keyboard fully assembled from AliExpress (Link here) and also a set of key caps which i think will do for now.
The keyboard is programable using Vial, a free software that allows for alot of customisation within the keyboard which is crucial as it has limited keys to use. This adventure not only redefined how I type but also challenged me to rethink ergonomics and efficiency.

### The Appeal of the 42-Key Split Keyboard

Traditional keyboards are ubiquitous, but their design hasn't significantly evolved to address ergonomic concerns. After experiencing wrist pain and realizing the inefficiency in my typing habits, I decided to explore alternative keyboard layouts. The 42-key split keyboard caught my attention due to its minimalistic design and ergonomic benefits. This keyboard promises:

Reduced Hand Movement: By limiting keys to the essentials and distributing them evenly, it reduces the strain on my hands and wrists.
Enhanced Ergonomics: The split design allows for a more natural hand position, minimizing discomfort during long typing sessions.
Customization: With tools like Vial, I can program the keyboard to suit my unique needs and preferences.
Programming with Vial
Vial is a powerful, open-source firmware that allows for extensive customization of keyboards. It supports features like layers, macros, and remapping, making it an ideal choice for someone like me who wanted to create a highly personalized typing experience.

Getting Started with Vial

Installation: I started by downloading and installing Vial on my computer. The process was straightforward, with comprehensive guides available online.

Configuration: The next step was configuring the keyboard layout. Vial's intuitive interface made it easy to drag and drop keys, creating a layout that matched my typing style.
Layer Management: One of the most powerful features of Vial is its support for layers. I created different layers for typing, shortcuts, and special characters, accessed through designated function keys. This setup minimized hand movement and enhanced my typing speed.

Overcoming the Learning Curve: As someone who didn't touch type correctly, transitioning to the home row position and limiting hand movement presented a steep learning curve. Here's how I managed the transition:

Commitment to Practice
Consistency is key. I dedicated time each day to practice typing on the new layout. It was frustrating initially, but perseverance paid off. Gradually, my muscle memory adapted to the new key positions.

Typing Tutors and Games
I used online typing tutors and games designed to improve touch typing skills. These tools provided structured practice and helped reinforce the home row technique.

Patience and Persistence
It's essential to be patient and celebrate small victories. Adapting to a new keyboard layout takes time, and each step forward, no matter how small, is progress.

Benefits Realized
Improved Ergonomics
The split keyboard design significantly reduced the strain on my wrists and hands. The natural positioning allowed me to type for longer periods without discomfort.

Increased Efficiency
With the customized layout and layers, I found my typing speed and accuracy improving. The reduced hand movement and intuitive key placements streamlined my workflow.

Personal Satisfaction
There's a unique satisfaction in creating a tool tailored to your needs. Programming the keyboard with Vial and seeing the results in my typing efficiency was immensely rewarding.

Conclusion
Switching to a 42-key split keyboard and programming it with Vial has been a game-changer in my typing journey. Despite the initial challenges, the benefits of improved ergonomics, increased efficiency, and personal satisfaction made it worthwhile. If you're considering a similar switch, I encourage you to embrace the challenge and enjoy the process of customizing a tool that truly works for you. Happy typing!
