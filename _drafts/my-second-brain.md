# Second Brain - Notion

To become a more organised individual I turn to a lot of different methods, But keeping detailed notes and documentation helps me the best.

I'm not to sure where the original concept for a second brain in notion [](an note taking application) came from, if you search YouTube a lot of people show how to create one. But for the past few month I have tweaked and tested a few iterations of my Dashboard to get to a point I am happy if covers my day to day and long term goals of personal organisation.

## My Dashboard

My Dashboard is a one stop shop to find information and keep organised notes for anything I need to dump out of my brain.
