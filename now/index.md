Here's what keeps me busy at the moment. [what?](https://nownownow.com/about)

## Enjoying spring

Spring is my favourite time of the year by far. The days are getting warmer, the nights are getting longer and there just seems like more time in the day to get jobs done. My list of jobs never seems to dwindle, from side projects like starting this new website, to personal design projects and to pottering around my house and garden.

We bought our house four years ago, and it has been a financial burden or as my girlfriend calls it "the money pit". But we wouldn't change owning a house for anything, we both feel so lucky to have something to call our own, my current home project are the garden and my office finally getting around to installing ethernet to hopefully improve my speeds upstairs.

In a few weeks time (end of may) it will be my first abroad holiday if over 6 years, pool, beer, food and friends for a week in Spain!

Life's good.

### Website Overhaul


### Skillshare Courses.

I'm currently watching a lot of skillshare, trying to improve my organisation and project management skills, Photography and Video editing and colour grading. Skillshare even though it is a little pricey at ¬£ per month, the quality of classes is fantastic. With so many skilled professionals passing on there knowledge it is a fantastic tool for anyone to have.



## üìö Reading
The last 3 books I've read, most recent at the top.

### _Endymion_ by Dan Simmons

After finishing the first two books of the "Hyperion Cantos" (which I really enjoyed) I wanted to finish the series. The last two books feel a little different than the first two, changing the main characters and forwarding the story by a few hundred years. It's a somewhat different story with back-references to the first few books, but the story is nevertheless exciting and keeps me coming back for more. The worldbuilding is top notch and I'm having a great time with the entire "Cantos".
