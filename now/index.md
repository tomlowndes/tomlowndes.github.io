Here's what keeps me busy at the moment. [what?](https://nownownow.com/about)

## Enjoying spring

Spring is my favourite time of the year by far. The days are getting warmer, the nights are getting longer and there just seems like more time in the day to get jobs done. My list of jobs never seems to dwindle, from side projects like starting this new website, to personal design projects and to pottering around my house and garden.

We bought our house four years ago, and it has been a financial burden or as my girlfriend calls it "the money pit". But we wouldn't change owning a house for anything, we both feel so lucky to have something to call our own, my current home project are the garden and my office finally getting around to installing ethernet to hopefully improve my speeds upstairs.

In a few weeks time (end of may) it will be my first abroad holiday if over 6 years, pool, beer, food and friends for a week in Spain!

Life's good.

### Website Overhaul


### Skillshare Courses.

I'm currently watching a lot of skillshare, trying to improve my organisation and project management skills, Photography and Video editing and colour grading. Skillshare even though it is a little pricey at ¬£ per month, the quality of classes is fantastic. With so many skilled professionals passing on there knowledge it is a fantastic tool for anyone to have.

## üìö Reading
The last 3 books I've read, most recent at the top.

### _Endymion_ by Dan Simmons

After finishing the first two books of the "Hyperion Cantos" (which I really enjoyed) I wanted to finish the series. The last two books feel a little different than the first two, changing the main characters and forwarding the story by a few hundred years. It's a somewhat different story with back-references to the first few books, but the story is nevertheless exciting and keeps me coming back for more. The worldbuilding is top notch and I'm having a great time with the entire "Cantos".

### _Software Architecture: The Hard Parts_ by Neal Ford, Mark Richards, Pramod Sadalage and Zhamak Dehghani

~~~I'm diving deep into software architecture at work and have been doing so for a good while now. This is not my first time diving deep into architecture questions and research, but it's comforting to have a book at hand that reassures me that some of the things I think and do are not completely nuts on the one hand, and on the other hand is thought provoking and giving me pointers at things I should look at more deeply that I hadn't considered before.

"Software Archutecture: The Hard Parts" goes into a lot of topics related to building large-scale (distributed) systems and drives one point home (a point I learned when I was at ThoughtWorks myself): **Software architecture is all about trade-offs.** There's never a perfect solution. Nothing is ever completely obvious. If you optimize for one thing, you often inevitably sacrifice another thing. That's how it goes, and balancing trade-offs for your specific needs is what it's all about. A nice book with a lot of examples and case studies that I can recommend to anyone facing the challenge of breaking down or modernizing a larger-scale system. It doesn't contain much ground-breakingly new but it's a comforting read that helps put things into perspective and inspire with a few ideas and thoughts.
