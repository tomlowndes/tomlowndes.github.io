Here's what keeps me busy at the moment. [what?](https://nownownow.com/about)

## Enjoying spring

Spring is my favourite time of the year by far. The days are getting warmer, the nights are getting longer and there just seems like more time in the day to get jobs done. My list of jobs never seems to dwindle, from side projects like starting this new website, to personal design projects and to pottering around my house and garden.

We bought our house four years ago, and it has been a financial burden or as my girlfriend calls it "the money pit". But we wouldn't change owning a house for anything, we both feel so lucky to have something to call our own, my current home project are the garden and my office finally getting around to installing ethernet to hopefully improve my speeds upstairs.

In a few weeks time (end of may) it will be my first abroad holiday if over 6 years, pool, beer, food and friends for a week in Spain!

Life's good.


## üë®‚Äçüíª Side Projects

### [Project folder template](https://github.com/camshand/project-creator-3000) - Geeking out over silly command-line tools

I came across a youtuber by the name of [Cam Shand](https://www.youtube.com/camshand), who has just built a cool custom desk. Whilst watching these videos he was explaining his stream deck setup and showed off a cool script, that opens a powershell window asks for the folder name then creates that custom folder based on a template and re-names files inside.  

I'm adapting the script for my two Project folders, one for Design and the other for Video. So with one push on the Stream Deck, it will launch a PowerShell ask for the name and create the appropriate folder inside my project folder.

### Website Overhaul

I am trying to build a new website using Jekyll and Github pages, fortunately so many talented coders have done this before so we can just steal there code and adapt it to our design preferences.   

### Skillshare Courses.

I'm currently watching a lot of skillshare, trying to improve my organisation and project management skills, Photography and Video editing and colour grading. Skillshare even though it is a little pricey, the quality of classes is fantastic. With so many skilled professionals passing on there knowledge it is a fantastic tool for anyone to have.

## üìö Reading
The books I'm reading.

### _The Devil's Hand_ by Jack Carr

After finishing the first three books of James Reece's adventures. I can't wait to get into the next book. I got into this series of books after watching the amazon adaptation staring Chris Prat as James Reece and have to say it was an amazing adaptation of the books (even through they change a bit.)
