Here's what keeps me busy at the moment. [what?](https://nownownow.com/about)

## Enjoying spring
The last few weeks have been packed with amazing activity, summer holidays with my wife, meeting friends and family, and generally having a good time and making the best out of this summer. I'm super grateful for living in a small town with so many good friends and family close by, with such a strong sense of community and tight-knit interaction. I hardly have any words to describe how great this feels and contributes to my well-being.

As summer's back for a few more days here in northern Germany, I'm about to head out on a camping trip with my lads for a weekend and I'm sure we're going to have a few great days of enjoying the outdoors, cooking together, having a few drinks, enjoying life and getting ready for summer to slowly fade into fall.

Life's good.

### Skillshare Courses.

I'm currently watching a lot of skillshare, trying to improve my organisation and project management skills, Photography and Video editing and colour grading. Skillshare even though it is a little pricey at ¬£ per month, the quality of classes is fantastic. With so many skilled professionals passing on there knowledge it is a fantastic tool for anyone to have.

## üìö Reading
The last 3 books I've read, most recent at the top.

### _Endymion_ by Dan Simmons

After finishing the first two books of the "Hyperion Cantos" (which I really enjoyed) I wanted to finish the series. The last two books feel a little different than the first two, changing the main characters and forwarding the story by a few hundred years. It's a somewhat different story with back-references to the first few books, but the story is nevertheless exciting and keeps me coming back for more. The worldbuilding is top notch and I'm having a great time with the entire "Cantos".

### _Software Architecture: The Hard Parts_ by Neal Ford, Mark Richards, Pramod Sadalage and Zhamak Dehghani

~~~I'm diving deep into software architecture at work and have been doing so for a good while now. This is not my first time diving deep into architecture questions and research, but it's comforting to have a book at hand that reassures me that some of the things I think and do are not completely nuts on the one hand, and on the other hand is thought provoking and giving me pointers at things I should look at more deeply that I hadn't considered before.

"Software Archutecture: The Hard Parts" goes into a lot of topics related to building large-scale (distributed) systems and drives one point home (a point I learned when I was at ThoughtWorks myself): **Software architecture is all about trade-offs.** There's never a perfect solution. Nothing is ever completely obvious. If you optimize for one thing, you often inevitably sacrifice another thing. That's how it goes, and balancing trade-offs for your specific needs is what it's all about. A nice book with a lot of examples and case studies that I can recommend to anyone facing the challenge of breaking down or modernizing a larger-scale system. It doesn't contain much ground-breakingly new but it's a comforting read that helps put things into perspective and inspire with a few ideas and thoughts.
